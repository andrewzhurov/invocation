UCAN is a chained-capability certificate. It contains all of the information that one would need to perform some action, and the provable authority to do so. This begs the question: can UCAN be used directly as an RPC language?

It is possible to use a UCAN directly for RPC when the intention is clear from context. This generally requires by putting more information on the channel than the UCAN itself (such as an HTTP path that a UCAN is sent to). Invocation includes strictly more information than delegation: all of the authorty, plus the command to perform the action.

## 1.1 Intuition

## 1.1.1 Car Keys

Akiko is going away for the weekend. Her good friend Boris is going to borrow her car while she's away. They meet at a nearby cafe, and Akiko hands Boris her car keys.

Boris now has the capability to drive Alice's car whenever he wants to. Depending on their plans for the rest of the day, Akiko may find Boris quite rude if he immedietly leaves the cafe to drive her car. On the other hand, if Akiko asks Boris to run some last minute pre-vacation errands for that require a car, she may expect Boris to immedietly drive off.

## 1.1.2 Lazy vs Eager Evaluation

In a referentially transparent setting, the authority to perform some action is equalivalent to having done so: a function and its results are interchangable. [Programming languages with call-by-need semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell) have shown that this can be a very straightforward programming model for pure computation. Effects under this model requires special handling, and whwn something will run can sometimes be unclear. 

Most languages use eager evaluation. Eager languages must contend directly with the distinction between a referance to a function and a command to run it. For instance, in JavaScript, adding parantheses to a function will run it. Omitting them lets the program pass around a reference to the function without immedietly invoking it.

``` js
const message = () => alert("hello world")
message // Nothing happens
message() // A message interups the user
```

Delegating a capability is like the statement `message`. Invocation is like `message()`. It's true that sometimes we know to run things from their surrounding context without the parentheses:

```js
[1,2,3].map(message) // Message runs 3 times 
```

However, there is clearly a distinction between passing a function and invoking it.

The same is true for capabilties: delegating the authority to do something is not the same as asking for it to be done immeditely, even if sometimes it's clear from context.

## 1.3 Order of Evaluation

Information about the scheduling, order, and [pipelining](FIXME) of actions is orthogonal to the flow of authority.

As we shall see in the [promise pipelining section](FIXME), asking an agent to perform a sequence of actions before you know the exact parameters requires delegating capabilties for all possible steps in the pipeline. Pulling pipelining detail out of the core UCAN spec serves two functions: it keeps the UCAN spec focused on the flow of authority, and makes salient the level of de facto authorty that the executor has (since they can claim any value as having returned for any step).

# 2 Roles

Invocation adds two new roles to UCAN: invoker and executor. The existing UCAN delegator and delgate pricipals MUST persist to the invocation.

| UCAN Field | Delegation                  | Invocation              |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| `iss`      | Transfer authority (active) | Request action (active) |
| `aud`      | Receive authority (passive) | Perform action (active) |

## 2.1 Invoker

The invoker signals to the executor that a task associated with a UCAN SHOULD be performed.

The invoker MUST be the UCAN delegator. Their DID MUST be authenticated in the `iss` field of the contained UCAN.

## 2.2 Executor

The executor is directed to perform some task described in the UCAN by the invoker.

The executor MUST be the UCAN delegate. Their DID MUST be set the in `aud` field of the contained UCAN.

# 3 Envelope

The invocation envelope is a thin wrapper around a UCAN that conveys that all of the contained UCAN actions SHOULD be performed.

All of the roles from the referenced UCANs MUST persist to the invocation per the [above table](FIXME).

The invocation wrapper MUST be signed by the same principal that issued the UCAN.

## 3.1 Fields

| Field         | Type                               | Value     | Descrption                                       | Required | Default |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ucan/invoke` | `CID`                              |           | The CID of the UCAN to invoke                    | Yes      |         |
| `v`           | `SemVer`                           | `"0.1.0"` | SemVer of the UCAN invocation object schema      | Yes      |         |
| `run`         | `"*" or {URI : {Ability : [Any]}}` |           | Which UCAN capabilities to run                   | No       | `"*"`   |
| `nnc`         | `String`                           |           | A unique nonce, to distinguish each invocation   | Yes      |         |
| `ext`         | `Any`                              |           | Nonnormative extended fields                     | No       | `null`  |
| `sig`         | `Bytes`                            |           | Signature of the rest of the field canonicalized | Yes      |         |
  
### 3.1.1 Invocation

The `ucan/invoke` field MUST contain CIDs pointing to the UCANs to invoke. The outmost UCAN being invoked MUST NOT contain any actions that are not intended to be executed.

### 3.1.2 Version

The `v` field MUST contain the version of the invocation object  schema.

### 3.1.3 Run Capabilities

The OPTIONAL `run` field MUST reference the actions contained in the UCAN are to be run during the invocation. To run all actions in the underlying UCAN, the `"*"` value MUST be used. If only specific actions (or [pipelines](FIXME)) are intended to be run, then they MUST be treated as a UCAN attenuation: all actions MUST be backed by a matching capability of equal or lesser scope.

The only difference for the attenuated case is that [promises](FIXME) MAY also be used as inputs to fields.

### 3.1.4 Nonce

The `nnc` field MUS contain a unique nonce. This field makes each invocation unique.

### 3.1.5 Extended Fields

The OPTIONAL `ext` field MAY contain arbitrary data. If not present, the `ext` field MUST me interpreted as `null`, including for [signature](#315-signature).

### 3.1.6 Signature

The `sig` field MUST contain the signature of the other fields. To construct the payload, the other fields MUST first be canonicalized as `dag-cbor`.

If serialzied as JSON, the `sig` field MUST be serialized as [unpadded base64url](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5).

## 3.2 IPLD Schema

``` ipldsch
type Invocation struct {
  inv &UCAN  -- The UCAN providing authority
  v   SemVer -- Version
  run Scope  -- Which actions to invoke
  nnc String -- Nonce
  ext Any    -- Extended fields
  sig Bytes  -- Signature
}

type Scope enum {
  | All ("*")
  | {URI : {Ability : [Any]}}
}

# 4 Isolated Capabilities

It is often important to be able to reference a specific capability in isolation, disentangling it from the its sibling capabilities and other configuration. This is important for being able to reference a specific Capabilty in Results, promise pipelining, logging, and for building external caches.

| Field | Type     | Description                                            | Required |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `res` | `URI`    | The (canonicalized) URI of the resource being accessed | Yes      |
| `aby` | `String` | The lowercase Ability called on the resource           | Yes      |
| `ins` | `[Any]`  | Any other inputs required for the call                 | Yes      |

``` ipldsch
type Capability struct {
  rsc URI     -- Resource
  aby Ability -- Ability
  ins [Any]   -- Inputs
}
```

``` json
{
  "rsc": "dns://_dnslink.example.com?TYPE=TXT",
  "aby": "crud/update",
  "ins": [{"value": "QmWqWBitVJX69QrEjzKsVTy3KQRK6snUoHaPSjmQpxvP1f"}]
}
```

# 5 Receipt

An invocation receipt is an attested result about the output of an invocation. A receipt MUST be attested via signature of the principal (the `aud` of the associated UCAN).

Note that this does not guarantee correctness of the result! The statement's veracity MUST be only understood as an attestation from the executor.

# 6 Promise Pipelining

> Machines grow faster and memories grow larger. But the speed of light is constant and New York is not getting any closer to Tokyo. As hardware continues to improve, the latency barrier between distant machines will increasingly dominate the performance of distributed computation. When distributed computational steps require unnecessary round trips, compositions of these steps can cause unnecessary cascading sequences of round trips
>
> Mark Miller, Robust Composition

At UCAN creation time, the UCAN MAY not yet have all of the information required to construct the next request in a sequence. Waiting for each request to complete before proceeding to the next action has a performance impact due to the amount of latency. [Promise pipelining](http://erights.org/elib/distrib/pipeline.html) is a solution to this problem: by referencing a prior invocation, a pipelined invocation can direct the executor to use the output of earlier invocations into the input of a later one. This liberates the invoker from waiting for each step.

The authority to execute later actions often cannot be fully attenuated in advance, since the executor controls the reported output of the prior step in a pipeline. When chosing to use pipelining, the invoker MUST delegate capabilities for any of the possible outputs. If tight control is required to limit authority, pipelining SHOULD NOT be used.

A promise MUST contain the CID of the target invocation, and the path of the
